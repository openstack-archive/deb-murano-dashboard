fixes:
  - Specifying a base class in the UI definition now also fetches all the packages with classes
    that inherit from that class, when glare is used. For example, if you
    specify the 'io.example.Parent' class, the dashboard
    fetches 'io.example.Child1' and 'io.example.Child2', and any other
    descendants of 'io.example.Parent' that are present.
