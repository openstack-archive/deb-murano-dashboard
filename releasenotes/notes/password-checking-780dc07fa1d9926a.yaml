fixes:
  - Fixed the password check in dynamic UI forms. Previously,
    the dashboard did not validate the password fields with IDs not ending with 'password'.
    Now, to determine whether to add default password validators to the field or not,
    the dashbord only checks the field type itself, instead of both field type and ending of the field ID.
