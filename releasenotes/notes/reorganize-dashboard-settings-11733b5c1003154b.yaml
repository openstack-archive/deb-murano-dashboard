features:
  - Murano dashboard now comes with the ``muranodashboard/local/local_settings.d/_50_murano.py``
    file that contains murano-specific settings for horizon
    (for example, ``MURANO_API_URL``).
upgrade:
  - Previously all murano-specific horizon settings had to be kept in ``local_settings.py``
    file of Horizon. You need to remove those settings from local_settings.py and
    copy ``muranodashboard/local/local_settings.d/_50_murano.py``
    to ``openstack_dashboard/local/local_settings.d/`` directory in horizon and keep all
    murano-related changes there.
